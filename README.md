# In Memory of KiXSTAr, gone but never forgotten.
## Thank you for every thing you have done for Siege and the esports community, your legacy will never die. 

It's a shame this project didn't make it to the place we wanted it to, but your heart was always in the right place in wanting to improve the community as much as you can. I believe you always wanted to leave something better than you entered it, and this project was the same when it came to the competitive community.
